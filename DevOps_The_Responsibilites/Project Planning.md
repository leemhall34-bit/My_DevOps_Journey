# Project Planning

The staff responsible for DevOps project planning should adopt the agile methodology to keep up with the CI/CD approach. Here are some tips to improve DevOps project planning:

- Split projects up into smaller, interdependent pieces of work.
- Create integrated plans that take unplanned work like incidents and defects into account.
- Use feedback from testing, staging, and deployments to re-plan ongoing projects.

Projects managers should use the same tools as the software developers. Using the same tooling enables the team to change priorities quickly, set up tracking mechanisms, and keep track of ongoing releases.
