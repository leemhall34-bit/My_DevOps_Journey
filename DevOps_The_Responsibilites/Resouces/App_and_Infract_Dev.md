# Application and Infrastructure Development

The DevOps approach to software development aims for regular, incremental changes to code versions. However, DevOps engineers rarely code from scratch or work directly on product code.

Engineers create solutions such as scripts or plugins that save the software developers’ time. These tasks do not require coding skills, but a DevOps engineer typically has mid-to-high scripting ability.

A DevOps engineer is responsible for the configuration and optimization of infrastructure components. Engineers typically use Infrastructure as Code solutions to speed up setup times and ensure more infrastructure flexibility.
