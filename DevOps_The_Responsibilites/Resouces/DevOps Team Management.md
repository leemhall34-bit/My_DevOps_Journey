# DevOps Team Management

Depending on the size of the team, one DevOps engineer may need to manage other experts. The person in charge of DevOps team management is responsible for:

- Organizing the logistics of an IT project.
- Ensuring all staff is aware of objectives and deadlines.
- Ensuring the staff has real-time visibility across the pipeline.
- Selecting the right CI/CD tools.
