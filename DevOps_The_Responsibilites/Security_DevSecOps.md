# Security (DevSecOps)

In traditional setups, security teams operate separately from software developers. This independent approach does not work for DevOps. Rapid development cycles require DevOps engineers to integrate security into the pipeline.

The need for integrated security gave rise to the term DevSecOps. DevSecOps requires a team to:

- Integrate application and infrastructure security into the pipeline with minimal disruption to operations.

- Automate security gates to keep the DevOps workflow quick.

- Select the right tools to integrate security continuously.
