# Maintenance

DevOps engineers perform routine application maintenance across the pipeline. Regular maintenance enables a team to:

- Ensure all environments run smoothly.
- Discover and remove vulnerabilities in the application, infrastructure, or integrations.
- Keep all software up to date.
- Find ways to improve the pipeline.
- Ensure service availability.
