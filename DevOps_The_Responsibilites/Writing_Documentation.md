# Writing Documentation

Documentation is the primary source of knowledge within a DevOps team. Formal documentation enables engineers to record new features, source code, system requirements, design instructions, bug fixes, tool guides, response plans, etc.

Good documentation is vital to:

- Incident response plans.
- Software reliability and availability.
- Onboarding new engineers.
- On-call rotations.
- Promoting DevOps best principles.
- Removing silos and tribal knowledge between different departments.
